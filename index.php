				<p><b>Profession</b>: Luxury Product Design Professional</p>
				<p><b>Technology</b>: MacPro Desktop(@work- design studio) MacBook Pro(@home- newer model and updated IOS, external hard drive), iPhone6s or higher(@mobile- International data plan as Jose' travels a handful of times a year for work, was born in Montreal and has lived internationally for both school and work).

He is not looking to work for a startup either (except his own, "Les Chardons-Bleus" which is located in Paris- working with his team on his own time).
