			<h2 align="left">Persona: Jos&eacute;</h2>
				<p><b>Name</b>: Jos&eacute; Ferrufino<br></p>
				<p><b>Age</b>: 33</p>
				<p><b>Profession</b>: Luxury Product Design Professional</p>
			<p><b>Technology</b>:
				<ul>
				<li>MacPro Desktop(<b>work</b>: design studio)</li>
				<li>MacBook Pro(<b>home</b>: newer model and updated IOS, external hard drive)</li>
				<li>iPhone6s or higher(<b>mobile</b>: International data plan as Jose' travels a handful of times a year for work, was born in Montreal and has lived internationally for both school and work)</li>
				<li>Absolutely efficient in Windows, but in the design industry, Mac is preferred.</li>
			</ul>
				<p><b>Attitudes and Behaviors</b>:Seasoned young professional with over a decade of experience in luxury product design. Not applying for jobs below his salary or expectation scope. Works internationally; has been employed in New York, Paris, and Lasaunne, Switzerland. Elevated sensibility.</p>
				<p><b>Frustrations and Needs</b>:Jose' is not looking to be hired in any other market aside from the luxury niche. He is not looking to work for a startup either (except his own, "Les Chardons-Bleus" which is located in Paris- working with his team on his own time). Salary expectations must be met as well as product expectations. Seeking "long-term" with growth potential, new contracts, expansion, etc.</p>
			<p><b>Main Goal</b>:
				Landing a full-time, high-end design position in the US, Europe, or Asia which will be "home" for at least 3 years. Currently residing in Brooklyn, relocation is a welcomed option and will be considered given the appropriate remuneration. As previously stated, emphasis on vertical growth potential within the company.</p>
