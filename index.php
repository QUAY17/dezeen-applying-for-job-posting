				<p><b>Name</b>: Jose' Ferrufino<br></p>
				<p><b>Age</b>: 33</p>
				<p><b>Profession</b>: Luxury Product Design Professional</p>
				<p><b>Technology</b>: MacPro Desktop(@work- design studio) MacBook Pro(@home- newer model and updated IOS, external hard drive), iPhone6s or higher(@mobile- International data plan as Jose' travels a handful of times a year for work, was born in Montreal and has lived internationally for both school and work).

				<p><b>Frustrations and Needs</b>:Jose' is not looking to be hired in any other market aside from the luxury niche. He is not looking to work for a startup either (except his own, "Les Chardons-Bleus" which is located in Paris- working with his team on his own time). Salary expectations must be met as well as product expectations. Seeking "long-term" with growth potential, new contracts, expansion, etc.</p>
			<p><b>Main Goal</b>:
				Landing a full-time, high-end design position in the US, Europe, or Asia which will be "home" for at least 3 years.
