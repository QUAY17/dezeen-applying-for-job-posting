				<p><b>Profession</b>: Luxury Product Design Professional</p>
			<p><b>Technology</b>:
				<ul>
				<li><b>MacPro Desktop</b> (work: design studio, updated IOS X Sierra)</li>
				<li><b>MacBook Pro</b> (home: newer model and updated IOS X Sierra, external hard drive)</li>
				<li><b>iPhone6s or higher</b> (mobile: IOS 10.2 with international data plan. Jose' travels a handful of times a year for work, was born in Montreal and has lived internationally for both school and work)</li>

				<p><b>Frustrations and Needs</b>:Jose' is not looking to be hired in any other market aside from the luxury niche. He is not looking to work for a startup either (except his own, "Les Chardons-Bleus" which is located in Paris- working with his team on his own time). Salary expectations must be met as well as product expectations. Seeking "long-term" with growth potential, new contracts, expansion, etc.</p>
